# React tutorial project 9 solo project results - Quizzical app

This is the result of following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org on youtube. [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=12s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

This is the last project of the tutorial. It is a solo project, meaning that the tutorial did not provide a walkthrough of coding it. The tutorial however did provide a figma design to style from and a set of requirements that had to be met to complete the project.

This tests the knowledge gained from the whole tutorial to see if I was able to practically use what was learnt.

The requirements of the project is shown below.
